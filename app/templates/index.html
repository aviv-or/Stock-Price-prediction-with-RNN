			 		This trading bot was created as a 1 day project. It is by no means complete, it is meant to be a proof of concept.
					In particular, I made this web app for experimenting with time series data and recurrent neural networks.
			 	</p>
			 		<hr>
			 	<p>
					The artificial neural network architecture for this model is the following:
						4 LSTM fully activated (RELU) layers,
						4 Dropout layers to improve convergence and a final Dense 
						layer to obtain the output prediction.
						I used ADAM optimizer and SME loss.

				  The price data is gathered from the Alpha Vantage free API.
				  This project is open-source on GitHub. If you're interested in the specifics of the web app,
