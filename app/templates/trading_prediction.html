            <p><strong>So, how does it work?</strong><br>
                RNNs (recurrent neural networks) are very different from the classical machine learning
                models. In fact, they are the first Deep Learning algorithm that can memorize or remember previous inputs
                in memory. This works really well with huge datasets and for predicting time-series data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</strong><br>
                LSTMs are a special kind of RNNs, which are capable of learning long-term dependencies.
                <br>
                The model I've decided to use is composed of 4 LSTM layers, amogst others. Each layer takes into
                consideration the last 60 days of data to make a prediction. This holds true for every predicted
                output.
                <br>
                This "memory" feature of LSTM makes them very powerful for time-series data, but it makes training 
                time much longer than usual.
